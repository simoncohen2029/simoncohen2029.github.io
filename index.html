 <h1>Apple iPhone 17: The Complete Guide</h1>

  <div class="intro">
    <p>Here we will be comparing all of Apple's newly released iPhone 17 models so you can figure out which model is best for your needs. Apple released these products on Friday, September 19, 2025. Their annual release of iPhones usually comes with controversy and many critics claiming that "It's the same iPhone every year." However this year, Apple redesigned the Pro and Pro Max models by including a longer rectangular camera bar on the rear of the phones.</p>
    <p>They also introduced a new Air model claiming to be the thinnest iPhone ever. Its sleek design fits better in both your hand and pocket.</p>
